# zaint : (oscaint) a payroll + erp work-in-progress system

Zaint: the selectra suite with pos, administration and nomina systems. 

The Asys consultores lie when said that selectra are opensource, we here 
will commit the 6 implementations of Venezuela of selectra and made public now, 
try reorganize some code and made public for anyone..

.. of course we offer more support and more cheat support rather than any.

## what about hacked, license, limitations  and security

Original selectra uses root conections and are weak again sql inyection attacks, 
also original selectra does not enforces and folow the GPL politics..
so then we take all codes available (dont worry we doit!) and made public by GPL, 
due selectra originally are GPL, made with GPL tools and use GPL technologies, so
so then must and are GPL complety.

currently there's some limitations, such like only runs well on the stupid apache server..
also the use of stupid arrays for handling all the stored objetcs (products, employers)

## code structure and colaboration

Coding standars are very poor on original selectra.. so then the colaboration 
only will focused in bugfixeds and reorganizations.

Any improvements must be made close to modular oriented, and *must use debian system libs*, 
the debian version must be squeeze, not lasted!.
